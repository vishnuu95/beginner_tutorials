\subsection*{Overview}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This repo demos a simple publisher and subscriber.
\item References were used from \href{http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials}{\tt http\+://wiki.\+ros.\+org/\+R\+O\+S/\+Tutorials}.
\item This repo also demos the use of Ros service.
\item On running demo.\+launch, after 7 seconds, the client(present in listener.\+cpp) sends a request to the server to change the message in the publisher ( in talker.\+cpp). This changes the message being published which can be seen in terminal prints
\item User can also change frequency of publish during launch.
\item Note the use of 5 levels of logging as well.
